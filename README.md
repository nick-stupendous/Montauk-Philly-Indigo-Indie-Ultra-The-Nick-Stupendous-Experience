# Montauk Philly Indigo Indie Ultra - The Nick Stupendous Experience

Hey everyone! 👋 This is a passion project by a fan, for fans. I am building an open-source remake of that TV show you remember, focusing on those first two spooky events from Fall 1983-84. Think of it as a love letter to the original, but rebuilt for modern PCs.

This started from the Android version floating around online, which then the company decided to buy the version, and delist it. However, now I am bringing it to PC with help from anyone who wants to pitch in. If life gets in the way and I can't continue, the project is set up so you can pick it up and keep it going. The story shouldn't end just because someone got busy.

## About the Game

It's a fantasy adventure with some sci-fi twists, all set during that eerie fall of '83-84. You'll recognize the vibe if you know the original, but I am adding my own touches too.

## What You'll Need to Run It

### Basic Setup
- **Computer:** Windows 10, macOS 10.14, or Ubuntu 20.04 (or similar Linux)
- **Processor:** Any dual-core from the last decade
- **Memory:** 4GB RAM (most computers have this)
- **Graphics:** Something that supports OpenGL 3.3 or Vulkan
- **Space:** About 1GB free on your hard drive

### If You Want It to Look Really Smooth
- **Computer:** Windows 11, macOS 12, or Ubuntu 22.04
- **Processor:** Quad-core (modern gaming PCs have this)
- **Memory:** 8GB RAM or more
- **Graphics:** A dedicated gaming graphics card
- **Space:** 2GB free (still less than most phone games!)

## Game Rating
