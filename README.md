# Montauk Philly Indigo Indie Ultra - The Nick Stupendous Experience
This will be a PC Indie (Native) Remake from a famous TV Show, that eventually fell down, in the year of 2025,  this will only include the first two events of the series and comics, that were from Fall or October/November from 1983-1984. This game is inspired by the android port of the Montauk TV show, accompanied by many other conspiracies, made by a fan, for the fans. This game will not only contain similar elements but it will be more of a inspired game that's for everyone, this is an open source version of the game, If this game gets archived, do not panic, there will always be light at the end of the tunne, if it doesn't come through, then you (the fans) can hopefully move the tradition and keep it going, I wish you all good luck on this game.

There is no way to rate a game, but here is my opinion on it, I tried.
